# DigiD QR Fixer
Firefox Add-on to remove DigiD logo from QR so it can be scanned more reliably

### Why?
The Dutch DigiD system requires you to scan a QR code to log in. Firefox (currently) does not render these QR codes perfectly, causing difficulty in scanning them. This add-on simply removes the DigiD logo from the QR code, increasing the scan success rate significantly.

### Installation
To install add-on into Firefox, go to the Add-on page: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/digid-qr-fixer/
